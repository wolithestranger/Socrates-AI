# 1.0 Schedule

# 2.0 Timer

# 3.0 Socrates AI


***TO DO**

# 1.0 Combine all the features 
    Later on, find a way to add all the features into one. I.E you can just enter a command to enter "add go to gym at 8pm to my schedule" or "turn on study mode. To do this, it would be preferable if the response time is faster. 

# 2.0 Give Socrates Memory
    If Socrates has memory I can continue building Socrates with Socrates. It would be fulfilling it's purpose

# 3.0 Give Socrates access to files in this directory
    This will allow it to see and keep track of files in directory as needed. It will not make any changes to the files (no idea how it would even do that). It should have access as this will make it easy to reference files when building projects.

# 4.0 Some form of basic UI will be needed soon
    So that formulas can be displayed etc.

    #4.1 Image submission will  important as well.
