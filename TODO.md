Keep track of pomodoro cycles each session. 
Have socrates have access to my productivity if i ask him to check or analyze over the week. 

# Fix read function. 
So that it doesnt takie in every further command as a list instead of a string. so fucking annoying 
Add line specification, e.g :
 command: read time_service.py 10-24 

Natural Language Integration
Instead of explicit commands, Socrates will detect file-related requests in natural language.

# change name on github to Socrates AI
Understand repercussions and deal with them


# In UI, Turn the pomodoro feature into a button
    Turn Study Mode into a button
